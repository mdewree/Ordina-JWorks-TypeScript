### Prerequisites
Some software is needed to perform this lab.  
1. **Editor**.  Choose the IDE your most comfortable with, most of them have support for TypeScript
2. **NodeJS**. NPM (package manager) is needed to get dependencies (compare with Maven or Gradle). Can be downloaded at https://nodejs.org/en/ . Avoid installing using brew/macports etc. as it can lead to permission problems. If NPM is installed correctly, you should be able to run **npm --version** in your terminal/command prompt

Let's go to our first exercise.
To go to the next exercise 
```sh
git checkout ex1-HelloWorld
```
